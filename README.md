Hi! I'm working on Arduino (Uno) and learning the language (?)
I'm learning CSS now. Folders are missing files is:
Css learn/css fonts
/files/sb.mp4
/files/sb.webm
I proably post the files on a zip folder, then you have your HTML examples. Btw, YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD IT. Cause somenone needs to compress files (Soon i delete this texts.). (make sure you have Visual Studio(or any mac/linux programmer)/Visual Studio Code)
Done. :) Have a great day :)
